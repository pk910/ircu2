Using SSL with IRCu

SSL in IRCu is principally pretty easy. You just have to compile 
the IRCd with the OpenSSL headers. This will be done automatically 
if the headers are found by the ./configure script.

To see if the configure script found the OpenSSL headers you just 
have to look into the summary at the end:
 OpenSSL:             yes
If the header was not found (`no` output) we have to install the 
required SSL header first. On Debian, this is quite simple: 
just install the following packages using the build in apt packet 
management: 
apt-get install libssl-dev

Now we have to create a valid certificate for the IRCu. For a "normal" 
IRC network usually a self signed SSL certificate should be enough. 
If you want to buy a certificate for 200€+ you can do that too, of course.

If you want to put this money aside and create your own SSL certificate now, 
you just have to type (example for openssl):
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout ircd.key -out ircd.crt

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: IMPORTANT: Here you have to enter the 
                                           address of your IRC Server.
                                           You can use FQHN form (x.y.net) or 
                                           wildcarts (for all servers) *.y.net.

As we have a valid SSL certificate now, we have to tell the IRCu where it
can be found. For this, we add a SSL block to the configuration (ircd.conf):
 SSL {
  certfile = "ircd.crt";
  keyfile = "ircd.key";
 };

The path (in our case ./ircd.crt) is relative to the lib directory of your 
IRCu installation. Now our IRCu should already be working with SSL. To use 
this feature, we now have to add a SSL port:
 Port {
  ssl = yes;
  port = 7776;
 };

According to RFC the port 6697 should also be used for SSL.
 Port {
  ssl = yes;
  port = 6697;
 };
